# Task Board

Task Board is a personal learning project created as part of my journey to become a front-end developer. It's designed as a simple and easy-to-use task management application that allows you to keep track of your tasks, add new tasks, mark them as completed, and remove tasks from the list. 

This project serves as a demonstration of my skills and progress in web development, with the primary goal of exploring how to utilize vanilla JavaScript in building a basic web application.

## Features
- **Add New Tasks:** Easily add new tasks by providing a name and description.
- **Mark as Completed:** Indicate tasks as done without removal from the list.
- **Remove Tasks:** Eliminate tasks from the list, starting with the last added task.

## Technology Stack
The project primarily utilizes the following technologies:

- **JavaScript:** This project primarily utilizes vanilla JavaScript to handle the core functionality.
- **HTML and CSS:** The project's user interface is built using HTML and styled with CSS to ensure an aesthetically pleasing and responsive design.
- **Local Storage:** I leverage Local Storage to efficiently store and manage tasks, providing a seamless user experience.
